Long ago in a distant fairy land,
there was a man known far and wiiide!
He was known to eat any meat,
*human*, chicken, horse and bovine!,

and then,

on the big day of his largest feast yet,
he rolled himself in a ball, AND
Oh what a feat!
He's one with the meat!
He's the only MEATBALL MAN (OOOOH!)


Though he'd become one,
with his many meats,
he was still hungry for yet more!
He scoured the land,
for all the meat,
he could roll up in and engorge!

and then..

the poor doomed people saw him in his might!
TOOK HIM IN AS THEIR OWN GOD, NOW
/BLOOD WILL BE PAID, SACRIFICES MADE!/
TO THE ONLY MEATBALL MAAAAAAN~!
